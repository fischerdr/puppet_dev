# This will source from an upstream repository over SSH and deploy
# environments to the relative 'environments/' directory, which is available
# to Vagrant hosts.
#
# Optionally, the remote option below can be changed to 'control' to use the
# locally cloned control repository as the source.  However, housekeeping of
# the local clone is up to you.
